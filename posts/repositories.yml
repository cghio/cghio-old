    This is a handy cross-platform desktop app to use Assemble, a static
    website generator written in Node.js. The app can download a Assemble
    website git repository to local directory, install dependencies and
    run grunt tasks.

    Designed for those probably every-day Windows users
    who know how to edit templates and HTML/CSS/JS files but don't know
    much about the commands.
